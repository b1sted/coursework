# Контрольный расчет

В данном разделе представлена реализация контрольных расчётов, выполненная в среде wxMaxima. Программа рассчитывает значения функций Uvx и Uvix на интервале, указанном в постановке задачи, с шагом, обеспечивающим вычисление на 500 точках. Такой подход позволяет достичь оптимальной точности при вычислительном эксперименте.

# Блок-схемы

В разделе представлены схемы алгоритмов ключевых функций программы. Для наглядного представления логики использованы диаграммы активностей стандарта UML, сгенерированные средствами PlantUML и являющиеся функциональным эквивалентом блок-схем по ГОСТ 19.701-90.

Для иллюстрации работы программы выбраны шесть наиболее репрезентативных функций, охватывающих общую структуру (`main`), основные вычислительные алгоритмы (`calculate_with_precision`, `calc_leading_edge`), формирование данных (`forming_Uvx`) и вывод/сохранение результатов (`forming_table`, `output_in_file`). Диаграммы для этих функций представлены ниже.

# Графики (обработка полученных результатов)

Графики, полученные в результате обработки данных, представлены ниже. Первый график отображает входной сигнал, второй — выходной сигнал. Оба графика построены на основе данных, рассчитанных программой на языке C. Форма графиков соответствует ожидаемой: входной сигнал имеет трапецеидальную форму, выходной сигнал — прямоугольную с плато. Полученные результаты подтверждают корректность работы программы и соответствие расчетов теоретическим ожиданиям.
